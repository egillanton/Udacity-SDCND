# **Project 2. Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program** 

<img src="CarND-P2.JPG" alt="Title Image" />

## Overview

In this project, I will use what I have learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I will then try out my model on images of German traffic signs that can be found on the web.

We have included an Ipython notebook that contains further instructions 
and starter code. Be sure to download the [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). 

We also want I to create a detailed writeup of the project. Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating Ir own writeup. The writeup can be either a markdown file or a pdf document.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file

## Setup (Windows 10)

#### Step 1. Download: [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

	> git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git
	> cd CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit

#### Step 2. Rename **meta_windows_patch.yml** to **meta.yml**

	> rename meta_windows_patch.yml meta.yml

#### Step 3. Install [`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on Ir computer

#### Step 4. Create a new `conda` [environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) **carnd-term1** using this `CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/environment.yml`
	
	> conda env create -f environment.yml

#### Step 5. Download this project

	> cd ..
	> git clone https://github.com/egillanton/Udacity-SDCND.git
	> cd 1.\ Computer\ Vision\ and\ Deep\ Learning/P2\ Traffic\ Sign\ Classifier/

#### Step 6. Activate I **carnd-term1** enviroment
	
	> activate carnd-term1


#### Step 7. Install required packages

	(carnd-term1) $ conda install numpy pandas matplotlib Pillow
	(carnd-term1) $ pip install opencv-python
	(carnd-term1) $ pip install moviepy

#### Step 8. Run the envirmoment using Jupyter Notebook

	(carnd-term1) $ jupyter notebook P2.pynb

Ir default browser should pop up.

**Each time I wish to work, activate Ir `conda` environment**

This should now work. If not, please refer to the link below:
