## What is Self-Driving Car Nanodegree (SDCND)?
Self-driving cars represent one of the most significant advances in modern history. Their impact will go beyond technology, beyond transportation, beyond urban planning to change our daily lives in ways we have yet to imagine.

Students who enroll in this program will master technologies that are going to shape the future. Through interactive projects in computer vision, robotic controls, localization, path planning, and more, you’ll prepare yourself for a key role in this incredible field.

## The Syllabus
### Term 1
#### Introduction

Meet the instructors — Sebastian Thrun, Ryan Keenan, and myself. Learn about the systems that comprise a self-driving car, and the structure of the program.
**Project: Detect Lane Lines**
Detect highway lane lines from a video stream. Use OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough transforms and Canny edge detection.

---
#### Deep Learning
* **Machine Learning**: Review fundamentals of machine learning, including regression and classification.
* **Neural Networks**: Learn about perceptrons, activation functions, and basic neural networks. Implement your own neural network in Python.
* **Logistic Classifier**: Study how to train a logistic classifier, using machine learning. Implement a logistic classifier in TensorFlow.
* **Optimization**: Investigate techniques for optimizing classifier performance, including validation and test sets, gradient descent, momentum, and learning rates.
* **Rectified Linear Units**: Evaluate activation functions and how they affect performance.
* **Regularization**: Learn techniques, including dropout, to avoid overfitting a network to the training data.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Study the building blocks of convolutional neural networks, including filters, stride, and pooling.

##### Project: Traffic Sign Classification
Implement and train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Use validation sets, pooling, and dropout to choose a network architecture and improve performance.
* **Keras**: Build a multi-layer convolutional network in Keras. Compare the simplicity of Keras to the flexibility of TensorFlow.
* **Transfer Learning**: Finetune pre-trained networks to solve your own problems. Study cannonical networks such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.

##### Project: Behavioral Cloning
Architect and train a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator. Collect your own training data and use it to clone your own driving behavior on a test track.

---
#### Computer Vision
* **Cameras**: Learn the physics of cameras, and how to calibrate, undistort, and transform image perspectives.
* **Lane Finding**: Study advanced techniques for lane detection with curved roads, adverse weather, and varied lighting.

##### Project: Advanced Lane Detection**
Detect lane lines in a variety of conditions, including changing road surfaces, curved roads, and variable lighting. Use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to implement camera calibration and transforms, as well as filters, polynomial fits, and splines.
* **Support Vector Machines**: Implement support vector machines and apply them to image classification.
* **Decision Trees**: Implement decision trees and apply them to image classification.
* **Histogram of Oriented Gradients**: Implement histogram of oriented gradients and apply it to image classification.
* **Deep Neural Networks**: Compare the classification performance of support vector machines, decision trees, histogram of oriented gradients, and deep neural networks.
* **Vehicle Tracking**: Review how to apply image classification techniques to vehicle tracking, along with basic filters to integrate vehicle position over time.

##### Project: Vehicle Tracking
Track vehicles in camera images using image classifiers such as SVMs, decision trees, HOG, and DNNs. Apply filters to fuse position data.
